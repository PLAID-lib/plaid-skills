# Dataset Conversion Examples

This folder contains **working examples** of converting external datasets
into the PLAID format.

Each script in this folder:
- was used to generate a real PLAID dataset,
- targets a **specific dataset and input format**,
- prioritizes correctness, clarity, and explicit semantics over generality.

These examples are meant to help users understand *how* to write PLAID
conversion code and to serve as reference material for tooling that assists
with PLAID usage.

---

## Scope and philosophy

The scripts in this folder are intentionally **dataset-specific**.

They:
- encode assumptions about the input data layout,
- rely on domain knowledge (e.g. mesh structure, time semantics),
- may use external scientific libraries to parse or construct data.

They are **not** intended to be:
- generic converters,
- reusable pipelines,
- or minimal tutorial examples.

For introductory or API-focused examples, see the other subfolders in
`examples/`.

## External dependencies

Some conversion scripts depend on libraries that are **not part of PLAID’s
core dependencies** (as declared in `pyproject.toml`).

These external dependencies are:
- required only to *convert* the corresponding dataset,
- not required to *load or use* the resulting PLAID dataset,
- intentionally not added to PLAID’s dependency list.

Users should inspect the imports at the top of each script to identify any
dataset-specific requirements.

### Per-example dependency and source matrix

| Script | Dataset | Likely external dependencies* | Raw data source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `drivaerml.py` | DrivAerML | `pandas`, OpenFOAM parser stack (`PyFoam` or custom), `Muscat` bridge | CAE ML datasets / HF dataset (see script header) |
| `force_asr.py` | ForceASR (`res-SENS`) | `Muscat`, VTK reader stack, `tqdm` | Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/7445749 |
| `pdebench_2d_darcy_flow.py` | PDEBench 2D Darcy Flow | `h5py`, `Muscat` | DaRUS PDEBench: https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18419/darus-2986 |
| `shapenetcar.py` | ShapeNet-Car | `plyfile`, `Muscat`, `datasets` | Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/13993629 |
| `thewell_turbulent_layer_2d.py` | The Well (Turbulent Radiative Layer 2D) | `h5py`, `Muscat` | HF dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/polymathic-ai/turbulent_radiative_layer_2D |

\* Dependencies can vary by local setup and parser choice; script imports remain authoritative.

## What to expect from a conversion script

A typical conversion script will:

- read data from one or more input files (e.g. HDF5, NetCDF),
- construct meshes or trees required by PLAID,
- assemble `Sample` objects with appropriate time and feature semantics,
- define a `ProblemDefinition`,
- write the resulting dataset to disk and optionally publish it.

Explicit control flow and dataset-specific logic are preferred over hidden
abstractions.

---

## Variability across conversion examples

Conversion scripts in this folder may differ significantly in structure.

Depending on the dataset, a script may:
- represent temporal trajectories or static samples,
- use structured grids or unstructured meshes,
- rely on sequential or parallel generators,
- target one or multiple storage backends.

This variability is intentional and reflects the diversity of real-world
datasets handled by PLAID.

---

## Temporal metadata and mixed feature semantics

Some conversion examples rely on external metadata files (e.g. PVD, XML)
to define the temporal structure of a dataset.

In such cases:
- time steps may not correspond directly to file indices,
- global quantities may vary over time,
- temporal subsampling may be applied intentionally.

These semantics are encoded explicitly in the conversion scripts and should
be preserved when adapting them to new datasets.

Examples in this folder:
- `force_asr.py` parses `.pvd` metadata and aligns globals with selected time steps.

---

## Field location and parameterized datasets

Some conversion examples use **cell-centered (element-based) fields**
rather than nodal fields. In such cases, fields are attached to mesh
elements (e.g. `CellData`, `elemFields`) and not to nodes.

Other examples generate multiple PLAID datasets by sweeping over one or
more physical or numerical parameters at the script level. Each parameter
value typically corresponds to a separate dataset or repository.

These choices are dataset-driven and intentionally explicit in the code.

Examples in this folder:
- **Cell-centered fields:** `pdebench_2d_darcy_flow.py`
- **Nodal fields:** `shapenetcar.py`, `force_asr.py`, `thewell_turbulent_layer_2d.py`
- **Parameterized sweep at script level:** `pdebench_2d_darcy_flow.py` (`beta` variants)

## Relation to PLAID documentation

Conceptual documentation for PLAID (data model, terminology, and APIs)
is available in the main documentation.

The conversion scripts in this folder should be read alongside the
documentation, but they are the **authoritative reference** for how PLAID
is used in real dataset conversions.

When in doubt:
- consult the documentation for conceptual definitions,
- consult these examples for concrete usage patterns.

---

## Notes for contributors

When adding a new conversion example:

- add a single script per dataset,
- keep dataset assumptions explicit in the code,
- avoid introducing new PLAID APIs solely for one dataset,
- do not refactor existing scripts to fit a uniform style.

Optional but encouraged:
- add a short header docstring describing the dataset and its structure,
- document any non-obvious PLAID semantics (e.g. initial conditions, trajectories).

---

## Intended audience

This folder is intended for:
- users converting their own scientific datasets to PLAID,
- contributors wanting to understand real-world PLAID usage,
- automated tools (including LLM-based assistants) that analyze PLAID code.

These examples reflect **how PLAID is used in practice**, not idealized or
simplified workflows.
